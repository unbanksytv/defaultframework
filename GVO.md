Examples NFT CONTRACT & STAKED ECR-20 CONTRACT

## GVO is 100% staked at the beginning by the genesis NFT sale also being the GVO sale, and automatically stake 33 sGVO on your behalf per each NFT that you mint. 

# The season zero genesis NFT sale is the GVO sale. 

In total, there are 999 NFTs with 333 NFTs of each of the 3 designs. Only 666 will be available for public sale, 222 of each of the three designs. The team will retain 90 out of 333 NFTs. Equivalent to 2970 GVO out of 32967 outstanding GVO supply. The remaining 243 NFTs will be kept within our treasury to seed our Genesis Pools where you will be able to stake your NFTs to earn GVO anytime a buy or sell is done within the pool.

The associated 8019 GVO will remain in the treasury staked earning rebases and used to own our liquidity on Sushiswap. Buying one of these NFTs for 0.333 ETH automatically stakes 33 sGVO for you. If you mint three NFTs, you will automatically have 99 sGVO staked. Each NFT adds 33 sGVO to your account.
The best game-theoretic strategy is tit-for-tat with cooperation first. We ensure from genesis that 100% of GVO are staked programmatically.

We own all our protocol liquidity, we will own our entire GVO-OHM LP pool from the very beginning, all fees turn into a revenue source for the GVO treasury. OHM is the decentralized reserve currency used by GVO. We bring Zeus’s original vision to life by backing our entire treasury by OHM; it requires 0.001 OHM/sOHM to mint 1 GVO. Good Vibes Ohmly will launch with three bonds which are WETH, OHM, and GVO-OHM LP.

By being powered by OHM, we use one of the best incentive structures and get exposure to the best parts of DeFi while having our entire treasury (3,3) earning rebases and growing not only in GVO, but also in OHM.

All of our websites will display “Powered by OHM” at the bottom of the page. We truly believe Olympus is the best-decentralized bank, and we’re the first real-world business to open an account. We look forward to being one of the largest OHM holders.

Once we reach 333,333 GVO supply, our APY reduction will go into effect in approximately 120 days around the launch our Season 1 Spring collection By launching only 33,000 GVO, we fulfill our needs of raising enough capital to fund our development and keep building, we raise enough to seed our LP, and we raise enough to seed our GVO/LP pools.

By Season 1, when GVO will have greater demand and more than 999 NFTs being released, the Collective can use our second protocol mechanism to set how much GVO is required to mint one of the NFTs.

If our demand is high, we can raise the amount of GVO required to mint, therefore regulating supply and demand. Drops can be time-limited, meaning unlimited NFTs can be sold within a certain period of time. Or, drops can be limited, meaning there’s a set supply of outstanding NFTs that can be minted. All of these factors go into consideration when deciding how much GVO to charge for each NFT.

**Phases**
GVO launches in three phases, 

Phase I:
The first phase will be staking and bonding launching at the same time as the genesis drop. We’re launching season zero: genesis drop, staking, and bonding on TBC

Phase II:
The second phase is GVO/NFT pools allowing users to sell/buy/stake their NFTs. Guaranteed liquidity if you’re selling your NFT, an easy way to buy if you want an NFT, and a way to earn GVO if you just want to stake your NFT in the pool.

Phase III:
The third phase is an easy-to-use frontend to claim your physical art. Swapping your NFT for a claimed version of the NFT, that swap generating a transaction hash, then deriving a QR code from that transaction hash, and finally, stitching it onto the physical art. Then create a simple user experience to submit your address, size, and email for confirmation & shipping updates. (we documented our collab with meta factory 150 days ago, we're as ready as ever to finally say, LFG)

**Who can mint?**

Minting will open at Perfect Timing on TBC. Minting will be open to people that secured their spot through boosting or joining the Discord before TBC, 3:33 PM EST. To all of the people who had one-on-one conversations with us, those that spoke with us on voice, and those that aligned themselves.

When about 300 people have secured their spot to mint, minting will be open until all 666 NFTs are sold out, with a max mint of three NFTs, and one max per transaction. There will be 666 NFTs available, with 222 of each NFT design.

There are 999 NFTs in total, 333 are reserved for the treasury & team, 90 of the 333 reserved NFTs will go to the team. This results in a 9% team, 24% treasury, and 67% public split.

**Staking**

If you mint the Genesis NFTs, you automagically receive 33 sGVO, rebasing every eight hours compounding at 333,333% APY. Staked sGVO can be unstaked for GVO, which can be sold to the GVO-OHM Sushiswap liquidity pool (LP) at any time. No restrictions, no lock-ups.

**Bonding**

Bonding will be available at launch as the second value accrual strategy, the first being the genesis mint, the second is bonds revenue on wETH, sOHM, and GVO-OHM LP bonds. It’s important to note; by using OHM as GVO’s reserve currency we get exposure to the best parts of DeFi. They handle the curation of the best assets to acquire into their treasury. By acquiring OHM, we automatically get exposure to a basket of the best assets in DeFi. This allows us to simplify Good Vibes Ohmly’s treasury by only holding OHM, ETH, and GVO and focus on our core product which is a membership NFT to get access to the lifestyle assets of the GVO Foundation and the curated Art Vaults.

**Protocol-Owned Liquidity (POL)**

By being the largest liquidity provider, we earn most of the fees on swaps in the GVO-OHM liquidity pool. OHM is our reserve currency (1 GVO is backed by 0.001 OHM), all OHM in treasury is staked (3,3), and all GVO is staked from the beginning by default. We are a brand and Olympus is the bank.
